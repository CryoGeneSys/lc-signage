# Hardware

The Live Signage system requires some assembly and bespoke component fabrication. Luckily, if one has access to a laser cutter at their local library or makerspace, this process becomes much easier.

## Physical Materials Needed

- Opaque Acrylic (Color choice can be used for branding. We used black for a clean look.) at 12" x 19" at 1/8th"

- Clear Acrylic (For replacable screen cover.) also at 12" x 19" at 1/8th

- Glue (G25?) Before using this glue, read the detailed discription below. It does not act like normal super glue!

- KYY Portable USB-C Computer Monitor

- Raspberry Pi 0 2 W (This MUST be the 2nd Edition of the Pi0W. The original Pi0W will not have enough resources to run this system! We tried!)

- 65W USB-C Laptop Charger

- 180Â° HDMI to Mini HDMI Adapter

- USB-C to Micro-USB Patch Cable

- Mini HDMI to HDMI Patch Cable

- 11 x 11 x 5.3 mm Anodized Aluminum Heat Sink (You can buy a pack of assorted heat sinks)

- Radio-remote Controlled Power Outlet Adapters. I recommend the Syantek 5 pack on Amazon, as you can have up to 5 seperate live signs on one remote, with a backup to give front facing employees.
  These should be on a band that doesn't have a lot of interference in your area. We use around 430 MHz.

- 1/2" Wood For Frame. If you plan on laser cutting this wood you will need to purchase it from a craft store and not a hardware store. Hardware stores treat their wood with flame-retardant and it makes
  it very difficult to create consistant cuts. You can also use laser cut pieces of 1/16ths inch craft wood that you can then layer, or just CNC the the 1/2' wood frame.

- A Micro SD Card (sometimes called a TF Card) of at least 8Gb from a reputable brand. Almost all the issues we have had with long term system stability can be directly contributed to using cheap after
  market micro SD cards. Use a PNY, Kingston, Samsung, etc.

- 1/4" - 20 Drywall Anchors (The length varies with the depth of your drywall. Ours was 1/2")

## Tools Needed
- Nitrile Gloves
- Isopropanol in a Spray Bottle
- Clear Cellophane Tape
- A 1/4" Drill Bit Rated for Metal
- A Drywall Saw
- A Drill
- A Drill Bit Set with Phillips Heads
- Washers with a 1/4" Diameter Hole
- A Can of Compressed Air or An Electric Duster
- A Cable Snake

- 3D Printer Filament Snips (A Great Universal Tool!)
- Plastic Rope for Pulling Cable
- A MicroSD to USB Adapter
- A Fan of Some Sort (I used a USB Desk Fan)
- A Ladder
- Another Person
