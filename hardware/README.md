# Hardware

The Live Signage system requires some assembly and bespoke component fabrication. Luckily, if one has access to a laser cutter at their local library or makerspace, this process becomes much easier. This tutorial is ment to be read in its entrirety before the first step is taken. Sign installation sites will need to be evaluated for feasibility before installation of the power delivery system and sign anchor points.

## Gather These First

### Materials Needed

- Opaque Acrylic (Color choice can be used for branding. We used black for a clean look.) at 12" x 19" at 1/8th"

- Clear Acrylic (For replacable screen cover.) also at 12" x 19" at 1/8th

- Glue (G25?) Before using this glue, read the detailed discription below. It does not act like normal super glue!

- KYY Portable USB-C Computer Monitor

- Raspberry Pi 0 2 W (This MUST be the 2nd Edition of the Pi0W. The original Pi0W will not have enough resources to run this system! We tried!)

- 65W USB-C Laptop Charger

- 180Â° HDMI to Mini HDMI Adapter

- USB-C to Micro-USB Patch Cable

- Mini HDMI to HDMI Patch Cable

- 11 x 11 x 5.3 mm Anodized Aluminum Heat Sink (You can buy a pack of assorted heat sinks)

- Radio-remote Controlled Power Outlet Adapters. I recommend the Syantek 5 pack on Amazon, as you can have up to 5 seperate live signs on one remote, with a backup to give front facing employees.
  These should be on a band that doesn't have a lot of interference in your area. We use around 430 MHz.

- 1/2" Wood For Frame. If you plan on laser cutting this wood you will need to purchase it from a craft store and not a hardware store. Hardware stores treat their wood with flame-retardant and it makes
  it very difficult to create consistant cuts. You can also use laser cut pieces of 1/16ths inch craft wood that you can then layer, or just CNC the the 1/2' wood frame.

- A Micro SD Card (sometimes called a TF Card) of at least 8Gb from a reputable brand. Almost all the issues we have had with long term system stability can be directly contributed to using cheap after
  market micro SD cards. Use a PNY, Kingston, Samsung, etc.

- 1/4" - 20 Drywall Anchors (The length varies with the depth of your drywall. Ours was 1/2")

### Tools Needed
- Nitrile Gloves
- Isopropanol in a Spray Bottle
- Clear Cellophane Tape
- A 1/4" Drill Bit Rated for Metal
- A Drywall Saw
- A Drill
- A Drill Bit Set with Phillips Heads
- Washers with a 1/4" Diameter Hole
- A Can of Compressed Air or An Electric Duster
- A Cable Snake
- Electrical Tape
- 3D Printer Filament Snips (A Great Universal Tool!)
- Plastic Rope for Pulling Cable
- A MicroSD to USB Adapter
- A Fan of Some Sort (I used a USB Desk Fan)
- A Ladder
- Another Person

### Software and Files Needed

- Raspberry Pi Imager
- MiniTool Partition Wizard
- Laser Cutter Software (We used LightBurn)
- LightBurn Cut Files OR use provided SVG file with your own laser cutter software
- Putty (Or any SSH program)
